# ChessDB

ChessDB is a chess statistics website where users can login to their account and download their monthly data from other
online chess websites. As most chess websites typically display low-level, basic statistics of a user's profile, the purpose
of ChessDB is to expand on this data to the users and give them graphical, more detailed ways to view their stats.
