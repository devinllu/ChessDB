# ChessDB

ChessDB is a chess statistics website where users can download their monthly data from other
Chess.com. Connected via the Chess.com API, a simply python script is run to scrape the data off 
of the URL site, and downloads all this data directly onto your local directory.

To run the project locally, simply type

###### python3 app.py

to run the project. Now it should appear on your localhost!
